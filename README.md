# covidtracker.io
The number of cases, deaths ,and recoveries of every affected country just on your one input!!!

wait the page as the data will take somtime to load.

The webpage id responsive and has different scrolling effects on both mobile and desktop.

The data that you will get is a day prior to the current day as the API that is used takes time to update the data.

It is my 4th javascript project and anyone who wants to contibute is most welcome!!!
